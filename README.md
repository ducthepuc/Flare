## Note

Flare is still very much in-development. Some important features are still being worked on and doesn't reflect the final state at all or are just completely, or the feature is completely none existent currently.

If you still want to run the project on your device, then you can run it locally. The steps are below:
## Run locally

To deploy this project downlaod the newest release from our [release page.](https://github.com/ducthepuc/Flare/releases)
After that create a virtual environment:

```bash
  python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```
Then install all the requirements:
```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After everything is installed, you need XAMPP to start the databse on your computer(if you don't have XAMPP installed, download it [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html))
After the installation you need to start the Apache module and the MySQL mdoule inside of the XAMPP control panel. 

Press the admin button on the MySQL module. At the Admin page you need to import the dbschema.sql. After all of that is done, you should be able to run and test out Flare.
